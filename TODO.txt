Okay, I think the code I have here is a decent start, but there are still a
few things I want to do:

- Change the API so that the __map_metadata struct is the thing that the 
  user holds onto and passes into functions
- Add assert statements to verify offsets, sizes, and whether key/value
  is a value/pointer/string. This is the best I can do without strong 
  compiler type checking; the checks will happen at runtime but I'll
  make it so you can turn them off with a #define somewhere.
